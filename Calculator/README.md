# Simple Calculator Web Application

This project is a basic web-based calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and supports percentages and parentheses for complex calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Percentage Support**: Calculate percentages dynamically.
- **Parentheses**: Handle complex calculations with parentheses for grouping.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message for invalid inputs.

## How It Works

1. **User Interface**:
   - A clean and intuitive layout with buttons for digits (0â€“9), operators, and utility functions (`C`, `=`, etc.).
   - An input field (`display`) to show the current equation or result.

2. **User Actions**:
   - Users can click buttons to append numbers and operators to the input.
   - Pressing `=` evaluates the current expression.
   - Pressing `C` clears the display.

3. **Supported Operations**:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
   - Modulus (`%`)
   - Parentheses (`(` and `)`)

4. **Validation**:
   - Ensures only valid mathematical expressions are evaluated.
   - Prevents syntax errors (e.g., `7%=`) by displaying an error message.

## Usage

1. Enter numbers and operators by clicking the buttons.
2. Use `=` to calculate the result of the entered expression.
3. Use `C` to clear the input and start fresh.

## Future Enhancements

- **Keyboard Input**: Enable support for using the keyboard to enter numbers and operators.
- **Scientific Calculator**: Add more advanced mathematical functions like square root, exponents, etc.
- **Theming**: Provide light and dark mode options for the calculator interface.
