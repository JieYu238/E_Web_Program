# Cash Register Change Calculator

This project is a simple cash register that calculates the correct change due to the customer when they pay for a product. The system allows you to input the price of an item, the cash provided by the customer, and gives you back the appropriate change. It also updates the cash drawer to reflect the remaining amounts after the change is given.

## Features

- **Price Input:** Displays the price of the item you want to buy.
- **Cash Input:** The customer enters the amount of money they give for the item.
- **Change Calculation:** The system calculates how much change the customer is owed.
- **Change Display:** The system will show the breakdown of coins and bills given as change.
- **Cash Drawer Update:** After each transaction, the system updates the cash drawer to reflect the change given.

## How it Works

1. **Enter Price:** The price of the item is displayed on the screen.
2. **Enter Cash:** The customer enters the cash they give for the item.
3. **Check Payment:** The system checks if the customer has provided enough cash to pay for the item.
   - If the customer gives exact cash, it will display "No change due."
   - If the customer gives more than the price, the system will calculate the correct change and show it in coins and bills.
4. **Update Cash Drawer:** The system updates the cash drawer based on the change that was given.

## Instructions

1. Enter the price of the item.
2. Enter the cash provided by the customer.
3. Click the "Purchase" button to complete the transaction.

The system will then display the amount of change due, or indicate if the cash is insufficient or exact.
