# Dice Roller

A simple and interactive application that simulates rolling a standard six-sided die (D6) and displays the result along with an image of the rolled die. Perfect for games, experiments, or just for fun!  

## Features  
- Roll one or more six-sided dice (D6).  
- Displays the result of each roll.  
- Shows an image representing the rolled die.  
- Randomized results for fairness.  

## Use Cases  
- Use as a replacement for physical dice in board games.  
- Simulate probability experiments and statistical analysis.  
- Generate random numbers for fun activities.  

## How It Works  
The dice roller uses a random number generator to simulate rolling one or more six-sided dice. Each roll generates a random result between 1 and 6, and an image corresponding to the result is displayed (e.g., a die face showing the number rolled).  

## Future Improvements  
- Add support for rolling multiple dice at once and showing results for each die.  
- Provide a history of previous rolls.  
- Enhance the user interface with animations.
