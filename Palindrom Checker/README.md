# Palindrome Checker

## Description
This is a simple tool that helps you check if a word or sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or number that reads the same backward as forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case).

## Features
- You can type in a word or sentence.
- It removes spaces, punctuation, and ignores case.
- It tells you if the input is a palindrome.

## How It Works
1. Enter a word or sentence in the text box.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. The tool will check if the text is the same backward and show the result.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main file with the layout (where you enter your text and see the result).
- `styles.css`: The file that makes the page look nice.
- `script.js`: The file with the logic that checks if your input is a palindrome.

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
3. Type your text in the input box.
4. Click "Check" to see if it's a palindrome.

### Example
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"

Result: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama is a palindrome"

## Requirements
